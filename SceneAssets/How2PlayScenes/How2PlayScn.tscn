the way. Points are calculated on how far you went, with multipliers based on
your ratio of distance to time, and how many Star Coins you have collected. Star
Coins are usually found from the upper levels of buildings.

You can slide under some obstacles.
If you run into a platform instead of landing on it, your run will end.
You can combine a slide into a jump for extra height."
